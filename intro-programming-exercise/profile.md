# My presentation

Hi all!

I am Carmen and I am from a beautiful city in the south of Spain (Granada). I love travelling and exploring new food, languages and meeting new people. At this moment I am unemployed, but I will have my hands full with this course and with my 2 years old son. I hope I can make it!


## My motivation to take this DS course
Now I want to upgrade my game taking this course to gain some more technical skills and redirect my career in that way.

## My "must see" in BCN

Next time I have the chance to visit Barcelona, some places I want to see for sure would be
-  **La Sagrada Familia**
-  **Casa Batlló** 
-  **Park Güell**

I also would for sure go for a walk around the **Born** or **Gracia** neighbourhoods.

## My career so far

After finishing my Business and Management degree I started working as a Financial Controller, but soon I discovered my passion for Marketing so I did my Master in that topic. After a while I also realised the power of data applied to Marketing, so I focus more on the analytic part for some time.

## Fun facts about me

I love practising yoga and I am not afraid to try new sports.
